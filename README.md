The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each item consumed. The objective of the game is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body while trying to collect as much food as possible. The game ends if the snake crashes into the boundaries of the screen or itself.

This game is implemented using Python and the Pygame library, which provides tools for creating graphical applications, handling user inputs, and managing game states.

Features:
Snake Movement: The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Food Generation: Food is randomly placed within the game area. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
Game Over Condition: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
Score: The score is displayed at the top of the screen, and it increases every time the snake eats food.
Game Restart Option: After the game ends, the player is prompted to either restart the game or quit.
Game Controls:
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body to stay in the game.
The game keeps track of the score based on the number of food items eaten.
Symbols in the Game:
Snake: Represented by a series of blocks or squares that follow each other. The snake grows longer as it eats food.
Food: Represented by a small square that appears randomly within the game area. The snake eats the food to grow longer.
Walls: The boundaries of the game area. The snake must avoid hitting these boundaries.
Score: A numerical value indicating how many pieces of food the snake has eaten. Each food item increases the snake's length.
Objective:
The primary goal is to eat as much food as possible, grow the snake, and avoid collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

Technology Stack:
Python: A powerful programming language used for game development.
Pygame: A library used for creating 2D games with Python. It handles the game's graphical interface, user input, and game events.
This game provides a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming, event handling, and graphical user interface (GUI) design.
